# fhir-editor
javascript fhir editor ui component

## Use Case
Creating and Editing FHIR resource is a common problem for User Interface and User Experience designers working with FHIR Resources.  This slows adoption.  
Because FHIR is machine readable and computable, the metadata (StructureDefinition, CodeSystem, and ValueSet resources) can be used to generate the UI in XHTML (inputs, labels, buttons, options, etc) and for FHIR a given FHIR Resource.

This is done in basic javascript and html with no framework dependencies.

## Usage
```npm run start```
